# Blog Post Template — Full Structure

Every post, no exceptions.

**Content order is fixed and non-negotiable: H1 → intro paragraph → featured image → remaining sections.**
Never place an image (including the featured image) between the H1 and the intro paragraph. Search engines and AI crawlers weight the first ~100 words of body text heavily for topical relevance and featured snippets — an image sitting before that text pushes the keyword-bearing content down the DOM and weakens that signal. It also delays reader orientation, especially on slow connections.

1. SEO metadata block: title, slug, focus keyword, secondary keywords, meta description
2. Schema markup in `<head>` (Article + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList)
3. H1
4. Intro paragraph — hook + focus keyword in the first sentence, within the first 100 words
5. Featured image + descriptive alt text (goes here, AFTER the intro — never before it)
6. Table of Contents block
7. 3+ H2 sections, ~200–300 words each, focus keyword appears naturally in at least one heading
8. FAQ section (H3 questions, `.faq-block` styling, 4–5 Q&As, AI-answer-ready per seo-rules.md)
9. Real YouTube video embed (never a placeholder note at publish time)
10. At least one internal link to a site tool — see mapping below
11. Related Posts block — 3 real cards once posts exist in those categories; never link to a post that doesn't exist yet
12. Breadcrumbs: Home › Blog › [Category] › [Post]
13. Word count: 1,200+ minimum
14. Full SEO checklist above, verified before submission (seo-rules.md)
15. Full Prose & Readability Protocol below, verified before submission (prose-image-rules.md)
